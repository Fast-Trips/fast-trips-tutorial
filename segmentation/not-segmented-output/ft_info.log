2017-05-11 14:21:43 MainProcess   Step 3. Calculate costs and probabilities for all pathset paths
2017-05-11 14:21:43 MainProcess           Adding fares to pathset
2017-05-11 14:21:44 MainProcess           Calculating overlap for chunk    1/   1 (len    190);  mem_use=Uknown; please install python package psutil
2017-05-11 14:21:44 MainProcess   Step 4. Choose a path for each passenger from their pathset
2017-05-11 14:21:44 MainProcess           Rejecting 0 previously chosen paths for huge costs
2017-05-11 14:21:44 MainProcess           Have     26 total passenger-trips, with     26 chosen paths,      0 fully rejected and      0 needing a choice
2017-05-11 14:21:44 MainProcess   Step 5. Put passenger paths on transit vehicles to get vehicle boards/alights/load and assess capacity constraints
2017-05-11 14:21:44 MainProcess   Step 5.1 Put passengers on transit vehicles.
2017-05-11 14:21:44 MainProcess   Step 5.2 Capacity constraints on transit vehicles.
2017-05-11 14:21:44 MainProcess           Bumping one at a time? false
2017-05-11 14:21:44 MainProcess           No over-capacity vehicles
2017-05-11 14:21:44 MainProcess   Step 6. Update dwell and travel times for transit vehicles
2017-05-11 14:21:45 MainProcess   No more path choices to make => Ending simulation loop
